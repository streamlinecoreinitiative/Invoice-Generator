# Invoice Generator - Technical Documentation

## Overview

The **Invoice Generator** is an offline desktop application built with Python and Tkinter. It enables users to create, manage, and print professional invoices without relying on an internet connection. The application automatically calculates totals, taxes, and discounts based on user inputs. This document outlines the technical details of the project, including its features, installation, code structure, and instructions for contribution.

## Features

- **Invoice Creation:**
  - Input client details (name, address, contact information)
  - Enter itemized lists with descriptions, unit prices, quantities, and discounts.
  - Automatic calculation of subtotals, tax (if applicable), and grand totals.
  - Customizable invoice numbers, dates, and payment terms.
  
- **Invoice Output:**
  - Generate professional invoice templates.
  - Print invoices or save them as PDF files (using an external PDF library if extended).

- **Data Management:**
  - Save invoices locally for record-keeping.
  - Support for multiple invoices and basic invoice management.

## System Requirements

- **Python 3.x**
- **Tkinter** – usually included with Python.
- **SQLite (optional)** – if you plan to add persistence for generated invoices.
- **ReportLab (optional)** – if you wish to export invoices as PDFs.

     ```bash
     source env/bin/activate
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     env\Scripts\activate
     ```

4. **Install Dependencies:**
